# Customerchurn
# Importing Libraries
## Imports essential libraries for data handling, visualization, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
 
# Loading the Dataset
## Reads the churn data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

# Initial Data Exploration
## Examines the first few rows, structure, and size of the dataset to understand the data layout and check for anomalies.

# Data Cleaning
## Checks for and handles missing values, and removes irrelevant columns such as identifiers (CustomerId, RowNumber, Surname).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Visualizes distributions and relationships between features to gain insights and detect patterns affecting customer churn.

# Feature Engineering
## Transforms categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Geography) into numerical format and applies scaling to numerical features for model readiness.

# Splitting the Dataset
## Splits the data into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance objectively.

# Model Building
## Trains one or more classification models using the training data to predict customer churn.

# Model Evaluation
## Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
